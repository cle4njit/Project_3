    <strong> How Does Our Calculator Showcase SOLID? </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Simple Calculator: </strong> In project 2, we worked on a calculator class with multiple
    different functions. Our calculator in itself demonstrates
    SOLID through having isolated functions that limit interaction to prevent potential malfunction due to crossing
    operations, the extension of every operation within different classes without allowing for potentially damaging modification,
    every operation is isolated enough to allow for easy addition of new operations like division, and there is little
    to no reliance on the derived/based classes for the parent/upper classes.</p>

    <strong>Single-Responsibility Principle: </strong> Singe-Responsibility Principles states that every component of your code should have one, and only one responsibility.
    As such, the only caveat to implementing SRP is making sure you have improperly assigned responsibilities from various areas in code.</p>
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Open-Closed Principle: </strong> The O stands for the Open-Closed Principle. OCP states that you should not need to modify the code you have already written to
    accommodate new functionality, but to be able to integrate and merge new code into it.  </p>

    <strong>Liskov Substitution Principle: </strong> The L in SOLID, the Liskov substitution principle states that classes within
    a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without causing error. Derived classes should also be able
    to extend their base class without changing their behavior.</p>

    <strong>Interface Segregation Principle: </strong> The I in SOLID, tell us that a class should only have the interface needed and
    to avoid methods that wonâ€™t work or that have no reason to be part of that class.</p>

    <strong>Dependency Inversion Principle: </strong> The final letter of D in SOLID, the dependency inversion principle states that
    classes should depend on abstraction rather than concretion. </p>
