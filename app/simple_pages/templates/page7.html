    <strong> The Terminology of Object-Oriented Programming </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Instantiation: </strong> Instantiation is fundamental to object-oriented programming. When instantiation is done
    in Python, a new class/object is cerated with methods which are called whenever a class is instantiated. This provides a basis for the creation of children classes and derived methods
    ato form.</p>

    <strong>Object: </strong> Any data type in programming is an object, which has a state and behavior.
    States are the attributes and properties of said object, while the behavior is the methods of execution for said object.
    They also have an identity, or a name to allow for other objects to use their methods. In Python, an object must first have
    a pre-provided value known as self, and can have an init method to provide initial values to any instantiated object. The
    image below is a visualization of Objects.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Class: </strong> A collection of objects, in programming classes consist of the base properties of which the objects are
    created. With some attributes and methods, classes in Python are defined by their keyword class, and have publicly
    accessible variables known as attributes which can be accessed by the dot operator.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Namespace: </strong> A collection of currently defined names that describe information about an object,
    Namespaces are comparable to a dictionary in which there is a set relation of object names and their actual values.
    These can be seen as four types: Built-in, which is all of Python's objects available to you at the start,
    global which is any of the names given to objects in the main program, local which is from another namespace, and
    enclosing which encapsulates the whole of the local namespace. </p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Constructor: </strong> A constructor is called whenever a new instance of a class is
    being built. Preparing the class/object for use, they are kind of like instance methods; but differ in that they have no
    defined return type and are not implicitly inherited. They also have different rules for scope
    modifiers and usually the same name as the declaring class.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Fixture: </strong> Fixtures
    are used in testing and help start setup services, as well as with the state or other operating environments. Accessed by test functions
    through arguments, each fixture often has a parameter named after it within the test function's definition. Fixtures allow for easy 'teardown'
    logic no matter how many are being used and without concern for singular care per error. Fixtures are mostly used
    in the first step of AAA, arrange. </p>
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Type Hint: </strong> Type hints are utilized to directly declare
    the data type of variables when they are declared. Available in more modern versions of python, when utilized
    they help ensure that small errors are caught, and help
    reinforce understanding of a code's architecture.</p>
    <br>

    <strong>Type Cast: </strong> Akin to type hints, type cast is used to manually convert a variable data type
    to an acceptable form in order to prevent errors of incompatible data being used in functions.</p>
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Unit Test: </strong> Unit testing is the process of testing each
    component of a program/application. Breaking up a larger project into small parts which have only a few inputs
    and only one output, the process of bug checking becomes more honed in and focused towards functions as well as making it easier to remove
    test code when a final product/version is shipped.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Static: </strong> Static means that something has an unchanging state. Not initialized within
    new scopes, they can be accessed via dot operators and only one copy of it is shared by all objects of a class.</p>

    <strong>Instance Method: </strong> Instance method must have one parameter of self which points to an
    instance of itself when called. With this parameter, it can freely access attributes and other methods upon itself
    which allows for easier modification and modification of its class.</p>

    <strong>Instance Property: </strong> Instance properties are properties that require an instance
    that is created with the help of the class name itself.</p>

    <strong>Static Method: </strong> Marked with @staticmethod, static methods don't have a self parameter,
    and thus cannot modify object state nor class state. They are restricted in what data can be accessed, and
    thus are useful for namespacing methods. The image below provides a diagram of all methods.</p>

    <strong>Static Property: </strong> Similar to an instance property, a static property is a property defined within a class;
    but they don't change throughout the program's runtime.</p>
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Encapsulation: </strong> Encapsulation is a fundamental concept of
    OOP in that it is the idea of wrapping data and the methods of that data within a single unit. This in turn allows for
    privatization of variables and methods to prevent accidental modification. This in turn creates two types of members: Protected and Private. </p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Inheritance: </strong> Deriving properties from a base class into child classes, inheritance is utilized as it
    helps represent relationships well, allows for easy re-usability without repetition and is transitive (class C which inherits
    from class B which inherits from class A also has class A properties). Inheritance can also be done in multiple levels,
    in that a child can have multiple base classes. The image below provides a diagram of this in the form of polygons.</p>
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Polymorphism: </strong> The condition of having multiple forms, Polymorphism is the same function
    name being utilized for different types. It allows for easier creation of multiple
    classes as well as usage of functions upon different data types. </p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Abstraction: </strong> Abstraction
    is the process of making a class a sort of blueprint for more detailed classes. This is done in order to allow child classes
    to be build from an abstract class, which contains abstract method(s) which have a declaration.
    This in turn allows for the quicker creation of child classes, as it provides a common interface for different implementations.

    <strong>Overview of SOLID: </strong> Introduced in 2000 by Robert C. Martin in his paper, "Design Principles and Design Patterns,"
    SOLID is an acronym for 5 different design principles. This was made in order to create projects that were more understandable,
    flexible and maintainable. Each part of SOLID is more explained in the SOLID page, as well as an example of how a simple calculator
    project demonstrates the principles of SOLID.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Overview of Design Patterns: </strong> In object-oriented programming, design patterns consists of description of certain
    objects and classes, as well as the attributes and dependencies of the class. Being reusable and thus able to speed up
    production, design patterns can be structural and behavioral, which define the behavior
    of said objects.</p>
